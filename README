Timer demo. This is a project used This project was used to practice the use of interrupt registries built into the Arduino chip. Also to practice wiring and using the I/Os on the Arduino.


This project uses interupt registers on the Arduino board to creat a 60 second timer. At the end of the 60 seconds there is a beep that runs for 5 seconds and then stops. 

Built onto a bread board are the following:
  - 2 7 segment displays to display the time
  - 2 Switch registers to increase available outputs from the Arduino
  - a button to reset the timer
  - a mic to reset the time via audio queue

I used a basic auto gain mic wired onto the bread board to reest the timer when it detects a loud noise (someone yelling). 
There is also a push button wired into the bread board to use to reset the counter in the even you dont want to yell.
